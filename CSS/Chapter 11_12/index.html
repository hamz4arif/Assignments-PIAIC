      PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVE FOR
      ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND CLOUD COMPUTING
    </h1>
    <p>
      Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC)
      is a privately funded notfor-profit educational initiative started by
      President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, Kazi Rahat Ali, and Zia Khan to help
      promote education, research and business opportunities in emerging tech
      fields like

    <h1 id="cnc">Cloud Native computing:</h1>
    <p>
      The<span class="boldtext"> Cloud Native Computing</span> program prepares the students to program in
      open source technologies like, <span class="boldtext">Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript,
      Node.js, React and React Native</span> while introducing the students to
      development of Microservices and software development techniques on cloud
      platforms like AWS.
    </p>
    <h1 id="ai">Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    <p>
      The artificial intelligence program of PIAIC takes the student through the
      foundation of the AI technology, via teaching programming in open source
      languages like <span class="boldtext">Python, Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask,</span> and
      teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and ending with
      real-life examples of modern day AI in practice
    </p>
    <h1 id="bc">BlockChain</h1>
    <p>
      The main emphasis of<span class="boldtext"> Blockchain</span> program is to understand the blockchains
      like<span class="boldtext"> Ethereum and Hyperledger</span> (Fabric), and learn to program in languages
      such as Solidity, JavaScript on frameworks like Node.js. The program also
      introduces them to development of Distributed Apps (DApps), frameworks
      like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of
      Blockchain-as-aservice (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin
      Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token.
    </p>
    <h1 id="iot">Internet of Things:</h1>
    <p>
      The <span class="boldtext">Internet of things</span> program introduces the students to open source
      development technologies like<span class="boldtext"> Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper,
      Diesel, Google Assistant, and Kubernetes</span> while making them efficient in
      developing Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoT Cloud, and voice computing for
      device control.
